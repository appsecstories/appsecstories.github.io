---

The **OWASP Top 10** represents the most critical security risks to web applications, updated in 2021 to reflect the current threat landscape. As an application security engineer, I've encountered these vulnerabilities countless times in production systems. This guide will walk you through each category with practical examples and actionable remediation strategies.

## What Changed in OWASP Top 10 2021?

The 2021 update brought significant changes:
- **A04 - Insecure Design** (New category)
- **A08 - Software and Data Integrity Failures** (New category) 
- **A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** (New category)

These additions reflect the evolving threat landscape and emphasize the importance of secure-by-design principles.

## The Complete OWASP Top 10 2021 List

### A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

**Risk Level**: Critical  
**Prevalence**: Very High

Broken Access Control occurs when users can act outside of their intended permissions, potentially accessing unauthorized functionality or data.

#### Common Examples:
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Regular user accessing admin functions
- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: User accessing another user's data
- **Direct Object Reference**: Manipulating URLs to access unauthorized resources

#### Code Example (Vulnerable):
```python
# Vulnerable: No authorization check
@app.route('/admin/users/<user_id>')
def get_user(user_id):
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```

#### Secure Implementation:
```python
# Secure: Proper authorization check
@app.route('/admin/users/<user_id>')
@require_admin_role
def get_user(user_id):
    if not current_user.can_access_user(user_id):
        abort(403)
    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```

#### Prevention Strategies:
1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
2. **Use Authorization Middleware**
3. **Apply Principle of Least Privilege**
4. **Regular Access Control Testing**

### A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: High

Previously known as "Sensitive Data Exposure," this category focuses on failures in cryptography that lead to sensitive data exposure.

#### Common Issues:
- **Weak Encryption Algorithms**: Using MD5, SHA1, or weak ciphers
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys and passwords in source code
- **Insufficient Transport Security**: Lack of HTTPS or weak TLS

#### Example - Secure Password Hashing:
```python
import bcrypt

# Secure password hashing
def hash_password(password):
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12)
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)

def verify_password(password, hashed):
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed)
```

### A03:2021 – Injection

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: High

Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

#### SQL Injection Example:
```python
# Vulnerable to SQL Injection
def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    return db.execute(query)

# Secure using parameterized queries
def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
    return db.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### A04:2021 – Insecure Design (NEW)

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: Medium

Insecure Design represents missing or ineffective control design, focusing on risks related to design and architectural flaws.

#### Key Principles for Secure Design:
1. **Threat Modeling**: Identify threats early in development
2. **Security by Design**: Build security into the architecture
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
4. **Fail Securely**: Secure defaults when systems fail

### A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: High

Security misconfigurations occur when security settings are not properly implemented or maintained.

#### Common Misconfigurations:
- **Default Credentials**: Using default passwords
- **Verbose Error Messages**: Exposing sensitive information
- **Unnecessary Features**: Running unused services
- **Missing Security Headers**: Lack of HSTS, CSP, etc.

#### Security Headers Example:
```python
# Flask example with security headers
@app.after_request
def add_security_headers(response):
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
    return response
```

### A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: High

Using components with known vulnerabilities can compromise your entire application.

#### Best Practices:
1. **Inventory Management**: Track all components and versions
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like OWASP Dependency Check
4. **Secure Sources**: Only use components from trusted sources

### A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: High

Authentication and session management implementations that are often incorrectly implemented.

#### Common Weaknesses:
- **Weak Passwords**: No complexity requirements
- **Session Fixation**: Reusing session IDs
- **Credential Stuffing**: Vulnerable to automated attacks

### A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures (NEW)

**Risk Level**: High  
**Prevalence**: Medium

This focuses on software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity.

#### Prevention Measures:
- **Digital Signatures**: Verify software authenticity
- **Integrity Checks**: Hash verification for downloads
- **Secure CI/CD**: Pipeline security measures

### A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Prevalence**: High

Insufficient logging and monitoring can prevent detection of security breaches.

#### Essential Logging:
```python
import logging

# Configure security logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('security.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

# Log security events
def log_failed_login(username, ip_address):
    logging.warning(f"Failed login attempt for user {username} from IP {ip_address}")
```

### A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (NEW)

**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Prevalence**: Medium

SSRF occurs when a web application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.

#### Prevention:
```python
import requests
from urllib.parse import urlparse

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['api.trusted-domain.com', 'secure-service.com']

def safe_request(url):
    parsed = urlparse(url)
    
    # Validate hostname
    if parsed.hostname not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
        raise ValueError("Unauthorized host")
    
    # Validate scheme
    if parsed.scheme not in ['http', 'https']:
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme")
    
    return requests.get(url, timeout=5)
```

## Conclusion

The OWASP Top 10 2021 provides a foundation for building secure applications, but remember that security is an ongoing process, not a checklist. Regular security assessments, developer training, and staying updated with the latest threats are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.

The new categories (Insecure Design, Software and Data Integrity Failures, and SSRF) highlight the importance of security-first thinking and the evolving nature of web application threats.

### Next Steps:
1. Conduct a security assessment of your current applications
2. Prioritize fixes based on risk and impact
3. Implement security controls systematically
4. Establish ongoing security monitoring and testing

Remember: **Security is everyone's responsibility**, and the OWASP Top 10 is your roadmap to building more secure applications.
