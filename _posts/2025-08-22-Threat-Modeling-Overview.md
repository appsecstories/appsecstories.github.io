excerpt: "Threat Modeling is the process essential for identifying and forcast the potential threats during design and early development phase to provide the countermeasures to mitigate threats"

**Threat Modeling** is a structured process for identifying, analyzing, and addressing potential threats to a system, application, or organization. It involves understanding the system, potential attackers, vulnerabilities, and devising mitigations. This process helps proactively spot vulnerabilities before exploitation, enabling risk mitigation and improved security.

## Why is Threat Modeling Required?

- Enables better risk management through systematic identification and prioritization of security risks.
- Helps in making informed decisions on security controls and resource allocation.
- Reduces security bugs and costs by integrating security early in development.
- Enhances security awareness and fosters a security-focused culture.
- Supports compliance with industry regulations by documenting threat analysis and risk assessments.
- Provides evidence of due diligence in security efforts.

## When is Threat Modeling Required?

- Typically done early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), especially during design.
- Can be applied to new systems, applications, business processes, or when significant changes are made.
- Useful whenever an organization wants to proactively address potential security risks and meet compliance requirements.

## Prerequisites for Threat Modeling:

- Clear understanding of the system or application including components, data flows, and interactions.
- Defined security objectives aligned with business goals, covering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Knowledge of potential assets that need protection.
- Gathered assumptions about the environment and trust boundaries.
- Established risk assessment criteria or frameworks for prioritizing threats.

## Key Stakeholders in Threat Modeling:

- Security teams or specialists who lead the threat identification and mitigation efforts.
- Software developers and architects who design and build the system.
- System analysts who understand system functionality and interactions.
- Business owners or product managers responsible for business goals and risk tolerance.
- Compliance and risk management personnel ensuring adherence to regulations.
- Quality assurance and testing teams for validation and verification of security controls.

In summary, threat modeling is a proactive, systematic approach to identify and mitigate risks in systems and applications by engaging cross-functional stakeholders early in development to protect valuable assets and support security compliance and risk management.
